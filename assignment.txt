1. Create a Cart screen.
2. In the card screen, there are two buttons.
    a. "Add Item 1" -> adds one more item 1. If item 1 is absent, add it in the cart. Rs. 100
    b. "Add Item 2" -> adds one more item 2. If item 2 is absent, add it in the cart. Rs. 150
3. When an item is added, show it on the screen immediately.
4. While showing an item, add a +, - and delete buttons
    a. + will increase the count by 1
    b. - will decrease the count by 1
    c. delete will remove the item from the cart

5. At the bottom, show total amount of the cart.

PS: You can create as many components. Try using "useReducer". "useState" is acceptable.
